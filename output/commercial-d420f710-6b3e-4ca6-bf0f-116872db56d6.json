Brazil's LGPD requires lawful basis for processing, data subject rights similar to GDPR, and registration with ANPD for certain processing activities. Key preparation steps: conduct jurisdiction-specific privacy impact assessments, review and update privacy policies for local requirements, establish local data protection officer roles where required, implement data subject rights procedures, and consider local data residency requirements.

Securities law compliance depends on whether your NFTs or tokens qualify as securities under the Howey test. If they do, you'll need SEC registration or exemptions. Additionally, consider CFTC jurisdiction for commodity-like tokens, state-level virtual currency regulations, and potential FinCEN registration as a Money Services Business (MSB).
