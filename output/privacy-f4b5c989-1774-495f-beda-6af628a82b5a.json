You'll need to conduct Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs) to evaluate risks in the destination country, implement supplementary measures if necessary, and ensure your US operations can comply with data subject rights. Employee data transfers also require clear lawful bases - typically legitimate interests balanced against employee rights, or explicit consent for sensitive processing.",

For employee data specifically, consider explicit informed consent for voluntary transfers (like international assignments) while maintaining separate systems for routine HR operations.
