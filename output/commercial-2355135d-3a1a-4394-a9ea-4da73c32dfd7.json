You cannot unilaterally change terms for existing customers without their consent or proper contractual provisions. Key considerations include: 1) Review existing agreements for modification clauses or termination rights, 2) Provide adequate notice (typically 30-90 days depending on your terms), 3) Consider grandfathering existing customers or offering transition incentives, 4) Ensure new terms comply with consumer protection laws in your jurisdictions. For new customers, you can implement the per-user model immediately. I'd recommend drafting amendment agreements for existing customers and reviewing your terms of service update procedures.",

Courts often scrutinize pricing changes as 'material modifications' that may require separate consideration or consent. The enforceability depends on: 1) How 'modify these terms' is interpreted in your jurisdiction, 2) Whether pricing is considered a fundamental term requiring mutual agreement, 3) If customers have reasonable alternatives or are locked into long-term commitments. Many states require pricing changes to be supported by new consideration or clearly contemplated in the original agreement. I'd recommend offering existing customers a choice: accept new pricing or terminate with reasonable notice period.

Document customer acceptance through clickwrap agreements or signed amendments. Consider offering annual contracts at current rates to provide pricing predictability. This approach demonstrates good faith, reduces breach of contract claims, and often results in higher customer retention than abrupt changes.",

However, the choice of law clause means New York standards likely apply. **Expedited Options**: 1) **Immediate Hire with Carve-Outs**: Hire her but restrict her from her former employer's specific clients/products initially, 2) **Declaratory Judgment Action**: File in Texas for quick ruling on enforceability - often resolved in 30-60 days, 3) **Consulting Agreement**: Start her as consultant while employment status is resolved, 4) **Negotiated Resolution**: Have her former employer agree to narrow restrictions in exchange for certain protections. **Critical**: Document that product launch timeline is independent business need, not related to competitive harm.
