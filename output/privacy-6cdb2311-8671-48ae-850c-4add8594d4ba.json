    "content": "Here's a balanced technical limitations explanation that demonstrates compliance while protecting trade secrets:\n\n**\"Technical Architecture and Data Availability Explanation\"**\n\n**Real-Time Processing Systems:**\n```\n\"Our recommendation system generates personalized content suggestions in real-time based on your current session and stored preferences. For performance and storage efficiency, individual recommendation events are not permanently stored. \n\nWhat we can provide:\n• Your current user profile and preference settings\n• Behavioral categories that influence recommendations (e.g., 'interested in technology topics')\n• Current recommendation outputs as they would appear to you today\n• General explanation of recommendation logic and factors considered\n\nWhat we cannot retrieve:\n• Historical recommendations shown on specific dates\n• Real-time decision paths for past recommendations\n• Temporary session data that has expired\n\nThis architecture is designed to protect user privacy by minimizing data retention while providing personalized experiences.\"\n```\n\n**AI Algorithm Transparency:**\n```\n\"Our AI recommendation system works by:\n1. Analyzing your content engagement patterns\n2. Identifying relevant topic categories and preferences\n3. Matching your interests with available content\n4. Personalizing delivery based on your usage patterns\n\nWe provide meaningful information about this logic while protecting proprietary algorithms that constitute trade secrets under applicable law. The system's goal is to enhance your experience by showing relevant content based on your demonstrated interests.\"\n```\n\n**Third-Party Data Coordination:**\n```\n\"We work with several analytics and service providers who may process your data on our behalf:\n\n• [Processor Name]: Data requested on [date], response pending\n• [Processor Name]: Data attached in separate file\n• [Processor Name]: Confirmed no personal data retained\n\nWe will forward any additional data from processors as it becomes available, typically within 15 business days of this response.\"\n```\n\n**Reasonable Efforts Statement:**\n```\n\"We have made reasonable technical and organizational efforts to identify and provide all personal data we hold about you, consistent with our system capabilities and legal obligations. If you believe we have missed specific data or have questions about any aspect of this response, please contact us at [privacy contact].\"\n```\n\nThis approach shows transparency, technical competence, and good faith compliance efforts. Would you like me to adjust the tone or add any specific technical details?",
