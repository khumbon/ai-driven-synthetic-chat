They want to limit their liability to direct damages only and exclude consequential damages. Our client is a healthcare provider implementing an EHR system. What's your take on this limitation?",

        "content": "For a healthcare EHR implementation, I'd strongly advise against accepting such broad limitations. Here's why:\n\n**Key Risks:**\n- EHR failures can cause significant business interruption and regulatory compliance issues\n- Healthcare data breaches carry substantial regulatory penalties (HIPAA violations can reach $1.5M per incident)\n- Patient safety implications could lead to malpractice exposure\n\n**Negotiation Strategy:**\n1. **Carve-outs**: Insist on excluding IP infringement, data breaches, and willful misconduct from damage limitations\n2. **Liability caps**: If they won't budge on consequential damages, negotiate for higher liability caps (2-3x annual fees minimum)\n3. **Insurance requirements**: Require E&O and cyber liability insurance with adequate coverage\n\n**Alternative language:**\n\"Notwithstanding any limitation of liability provision, Vendor shall be liable for all damages arising from: (a) breach of confidentiality or data security obligations; (b) intellectual property infringement; (c) gross negligence or willful misconduct.\"\n\nGiven the critical nature of EHR systems in healthcare, this isn't the place to accept broad liability limitations.",

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Red Flags with Mutual Indemnification:**\n- You could be liable if their software causes harm when used properly\n- Creates exposure for their product defects or security vulnerabilities\n- Healthcare data incidents could trigger your indemnification obligations\n\n**Counter-proposal Structure:**\n**Vendor indemnifies for:**\n- IP infringement claims\n- Software defects and security vulnerabilities  \n- Violation of laws/regulations in software design\n- Data breaches caused by their systems\n\n**Client indemnifies only for:**\n- Misuse of software outside scope of license\n- Modifications made by client to the software\n- Integration with unauthorized third-party systems\n- Client's own data content (not software-related issues)\n\n**Negotiation language:**\n\"Client's indemnification obligations are limited to claims arising solely from Client's: (i) material breach of this Agreement; (ii) unauthorized modification of the Software; or (iii) use of the Software in violation of applicable law or outside the scope of the licensed use.\"\n\nThe goal is ensuring they own liability for their product while you only cover your own improper actions. In healthcare, this distinction is critical given regulatory exposure.",

        "content": "A 12-month limitation period is unreasonably short for a 5-year healthcare technology agreement. Here's why this is problematic:\n\n**Issues with 12-Month Period:**\n- Healthcare compliance issues often surface during audits (which may occur annually or less frequently)\n- Data breach impacts may not be discovered immediately\n- Integration problems with other systems may take time to manifest\n- Regulatory investigations can take years to develop\n\n**Better Approach:**\n1. **Tiered limitation periods:**\n   - General contract claims: 2-3 years from discovery\n   - Data security/privacy breaches: 3-4 years from discovery\n   - IP infringement: No limitation or statutory period\n   - Indemnification claims: Match underlying statute of limitations\n\n2. **Discovery rule:** \"Claims must be brought within [X] years after the claiming party knew or reasonably should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim.\"\n\n**Proposed language:**\n\"Except for claims relating to confidentiality, data security, intellectual property infringement, or indemnification obligations, neither party may bring a claim more than three (3) years after the date such party first became aware of the facts giving rise to such claim.\"\n\n**Negotiation position:** \nEmphasize that healthcare regulatory compliance requires longer periods for claim discovery. Offer to match their 12 months for payment disputes only, but insist on longer periods for substantive performance and compliance issues.\n\nThis protects your client's ability to address issues that may not surface immediately in complex healthcare implementations.",
