During partnership dissolution, partners have **fiduciary duties** that continue until the partnership is fully wound up. Directly soliciting partnership clients for personal benefit likely violates these duties and could constitute breach of fiduciary duty and unfair competition.\n\n**Immediate protective steps**: 1) Send written notice that client solicitation violates his fiduciary duties, 2) Consider seeking a temporary restraining order if he follows through, 3) Notify key clients jointly about the dissolution to control the narrative.\n\n**Valuation dispute**: You're right to object to his friend as appraiser. Demand either: 1) A truly independent certified business appraiser (preferably one specializing in marketing agencies), 2) Each side selects an appraiser, then those two select a third if they disagree, or 3) Court-appointed appraiser if you can't agree.\n\n**Client relationship protection**: Document which clients were brought in by whom, but remember that revenue generated and relationships developed during the partnership belong to the partnership. Consider whether jointly approaching key clients about continuing relationships might be more valuable than fighting over who 'owns' them.",

Your partner's direct client solicitation during ongoing partnership dissolution is a clear breach of fiduciary duty.

Courts routinely grant these in partnership dissolution cases.\n\n**Hostile dissolution considerations**: Given his conduct, yes, this should be treated as hostile dissolution. This affects your strategy: 1) **Damages claims** - His solicitation may have damaged the business value you're both entitled to share, 2) **Valuation date** - May need to use pre-solicitation valuation to avoid rewarding his breach, 3) **Control of wind-up** - Court may need to appoint neutral party to manage dissolution process.\n\n**Urgent action items**: Immediately contact those three clients to clarify that no decisions about ongoing relationships should be made until dissolution is complete.

Since your contract specifies German law, German commercial law will govern interpretation, but enforcement may occur in multiple jurisdictions depending on where assets and operations are located.\n\n**German law considerations**: German commercial law generally favors distributor protection more than US law, especially for established relationships. Key factors: 1) **Good faith termination requirements** - German law requires 'wichtiger Grund' (important reason) for termination, 2) **Notice periods** - Often longer than US standards, 3) **Compensation rights** - German law may require compensation for lost distribution rights.\n\n**Online sales interpretation**: This hinges on your contract's specific language about sales channels. German courts interpret distribution agreements based on commercial purpose and established course of dealing. If you've been selling online for years without objection, this supports your position.\n\n**Strategic considerations**: The manufacturer's desire to go direct likely violates the exclusivity provisions. Document your investment in the territory, marketing efforts, and relationship building - these strengthen claims for compensation under German law.",

German Commercial Code typically requires notice periods proportional to relationship length and investment - often 6 months to 2 years for established distributorships.\n\n**Direct sales violation**: If you have true exclusivity in North America, the manufacturer cannot bypass you to sell directly to big box retailers - this would breach their own exclusivity grant to you. This is actually stronger than your online sales position.\n\n**Immediate actions needed**: 1) Send formal response disputing the termination basis and notice period adequacy, 2) Document all online sales history and their acceptance/knowledge, 3) Calculate your investments in market development, inventory, marketing, 4) Consider filing for injunctive relief in German courts or seeking emergency arbitration if your contract has arbitration clauses.",

If your agreement grants exclusive North American distribution rights, their intention to work directly with major retailers is a clear breach of the exclusivity provision - and this breach may actually invalidate their termination attempt.\n\n**German law advantage**: Under German commercial principles, a party cannot terminate for alleged breach while simultaneously breaching the same contract. Their plan to bypass your exclusivity may void the termination notice entirely.\n\n**Remedies available**: 1) **Injunctive relief** - Stop them from negotiating direct retail deals during your exclusive period, 2) **Damages** - Lost profits from the premature termination and exclusivity breach, 3) **Specific performance** - Force them to honor the full contract term.\n\n**Jurisdictional strategy**: While German law applies, you may have venue options. Consider where enforcement will be most effective - German courts for contract interpretation, US courts if you need to attach US assets or stop US retail negotiations.\n\n**Critical timeline**: Document their direct sales negotiations immediately. If they've already begun discussions with US retailers, this proves bad faith and strengthens your position that the termination is pretextual. The combination of insufficient notice period, accepted online sales course of dealing, and their own exclusivity breach creates a strong defense against termination.",

The UK requires separate VAT registration if sales exceed £85,000 annually.\n\nFor data protection: GDPR compliance is mandatory for EU customers, requiring privacy policies, consent mechanisms, data processing agreements with vendors, and potentially a EU representative. The UK GDPR has similar requirements post-Brexit.\n\nConsumer protection involves: 14-day cooling-off periods for online purchases, clear terms and conditions in local languages, transparent pricing including all taxes, and compliance with distance selling regulations.
