Litigation Preparation Risks:**\\n- Providing detailed disciplinary records could preview defense strategy\\n- Performance documentation might reveal company's legal position\\n- Communication patterns could indicate investigation timeline\\n\\n**2. Recommended Protective Measures:**\\n- **Legal Review**: Have employment counsel review all documents before disclosure\\n- **Privilege Log**: Create detailed log of withheld privileged documents\\n- **Strategic Redaction**: Consider redacting legal strategy elements while preserving employee's personal data rights\\n\\n**3. Balancing Compliance vs. Legal Strategy:**\\n\\n**Must Provide (Even if Litigation Risk):**\\n- Employee's personal data in HR files\\n- Factual performance records\\n- Disciplinary records about the individual\\n- Communication to/about the employee (with third-party redactions)\\n\\n**Can Withhold:**\\n- Attorney work product\\n- Litigation strategy documents\\n- Settlement discussions\\n- Legal advice communications\\n\\n**Practical Approach:**\\n\\n**Document Review Process:**\\n1. **First Pass**: Identify employee personal data\\n2. **Second Pass**: Privilege review by employment counsel\\n3. **Third Pass**: Strategic review for litigation implications\\n4. **Final Pass**: Third-party privacy redactions\\n\\n**Communication Strategy:**\\n- Maintain professional, compliant tone\\n- Avoid any language suggesting obstruction\\n- Document all decisions with legal justification\\n- Consider whether early settlement discussions might be appropriate\\n\\n**Key Warning Signs:**\\n- If request seems designed for litigation discovery\\n- If timing coincides with limitation periods\\n- If follow-up requests target specific document types\\n\\n**Recommended Next Steps:**\\n1. **Immediate**: Send extension notice\\n2. **This Week**: Brief employment counsel on request and litigation risk\\n3. **Ongoing**: Parallel track - prepare DSAR response while assessing settlement possibilities\\n\\nGiven the litigation context, I strongly recommend involving employment counsel in the document review process.
