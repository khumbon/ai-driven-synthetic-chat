Technical Considerations:**\\n- **Consent expiration:** Stop non-essential cookies when consent expires\\n- **Grace period:** 30-day window for users to refresh\\n- **Default state:** Revert to essential-only if no refresh\\n- **Logging:** Record all refresh events and user choices\\n\\n**Sample Refresh Banner:**\\n*\\\"It's been over a year since you set your cookie preferences.

Google Analytics Implementation:**\\n\\n**Traditional Loading (DON'T DO THIS):**\\n```html\\n<!-- This loads immediately and violates GDPR -->\\n<script async src=\\\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID\\\"></script>\\n```\\n\\n**Compliant Implementation:**\\n```javascript\\n// 1. Check consent status first\\nfunction hasAnalyticsConsent() {\\n    // Check your consent management system\\n    return getConsentStatus('analytics'); // Your consent function\\n}\\n\\n// 2. Load Google Analytics only after consent\\nfunction loadGoogleAnalytics() {\\n    if (hasAnalyticsConsent()) {\\n        // Dynamically load gtag script\\n        const script = document.createElement('script');\\n        script.async = true;\\n        script.src = 'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID';\\n        document.head.appendChild(script);\\n        \\n        // Initialize after script loads\\n        script.onload = function() {\\n            window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\\n            function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\\n            gtag('js', new Date());\\n            gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID', {\\n                'anonymize_ip': true // GDPR best practice\\n            });\\n        };\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// 3. Call after consent is given\\ndocument.addEventListener('consent-updated', function(e) {\\n    if (e.detail.analytics === true) {\\n        loadGoogleAnalytics();\\n    }\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**2. Facebook Pixel Implementation:**\\n\\n**Compliant Facebook Pixel Loading:**\\n```javascript\\nfunction loadFacebookPixel() {\\n    if (hasMarketingConsent()) {\\n        // Facebook Pixel Code\\n        !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)\\n        {if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?\\n        n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};\\n        if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';\\n        n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;\\n        t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];\\n        s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',\\n        'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');\\n        \\n        fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID');\\n        fbq('track', 'PageView');\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// Load after marketing consent\\ndocument.addEventListener('consent-updated', function(e) {\\n    if (e.detail.marketing === true) {\\n        loadFacebookPixel();\\n    }\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**3. Google Tag Manager Approach (Recommended):**\\n\\n**GTM Configuration:**\\n```javascript\\n// 1. Create consent variables in GTM\\n// Variable Name: Analytics Consent\\n// Type: Custom JavaScript\\nfunction() {\\n    return getConsentStatus('analytics');\\n}\\n\\n// 2. Use consent variables as trigger conditions\\n// Trigger: Analytics Consent Given\\n// Type: Custom Event\\n// Event Name: consent_analytics\\n// Fires when: Analytics Consent equals true\\n\\n// 3. Fire consent events from your CMP\\nfunction updateConsent(preferences) {\\n    // Update your consent storage\\n    setConsentStatus(preferences);\\n    \\n    // Fire GTM events\\n    if (preferences.analytics) {\\n        dataLayer.push({'event': 'consent_analytics'});\\n    }\\n    if (preferences.marketing) {\\n        dataLayer.push({'event': 'consent_marketing'});\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**4. Complete Integration Example:**\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Consent Management Integration\\nclass ConsentManager {\\n    constructor() {\\n        this.consentGiven = this.getStoredConsent();\\n        this.bindEvents();\\n    }\\n    \\n    bindEvents() {\\n        // Listen for consent banner interactions\\n        document.addEventListener('consent-accept', (e) => {\\n            this.updateConsent(e.detail.preferences);\\n        });\\n    }\\n    \\n    updateConsent(preferences) {\\n        this.consentGiven = preferences;\\n        localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', JSON.stringify({\\n            preferences: preferences,\\n            timestamp: new Date().toISOString()\\n        }));\\n        \\n        // Load tracking scripts based on consent\\n        if (preferences.analytics && !this.analyticsLoaded) {\\n            this.loadGoogleAnalytics();\\n            this.analyticsLoaded = true;\\n        }\\n        \\n        if (preferences.marketing && !this.marketingLoaded) {\\n            this.loadFacebookPixel();\\n            this.marketingLoaded = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    getStoredConsent() {\\n        const stored = localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent');\\n        if (stored) {\\n            const consent = JSON.parse(stored);\\n            "
