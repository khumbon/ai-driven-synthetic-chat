Tiered Service Credits:**\n- 99.9% - 99.5%: 25% of monthly fees\n- 99.5% - 99.0%: 50% of monthly fees  \n- Below 99.0%: 100% of monthly fees\n- **Critical Outage** (complete service failure >2 hours): Additional 50% penalty\n\n**2. Business Impact Liquidated Damages:**\n*\"For outages during peak business hours [define your hours], Provider shall pay liquidated damages of $[X] per hour, representing genuine pre-estimate of Customer's lost revenue, not penalty.\"*\n\n**3. Escalating Consequences:**\n*\"If monthly uptime falls below 99.9% for two consecutive months, Customer may: (a) terminate without penalty; (b) engage alternative providers at Provider's expense; or (c) receive additional 6 months of service credits.\"*\n\n**OPERATIONAL PROTECTIONS:**\n\n**4. Root Cause Analysis:**\n*\"Provider must deliver detailed RCA within 5 business days of any outage >30 minutes, including remediation steps to prevent recurrence.\"*\n\n**5. Priority Support:**\n*\"SLA failures trigger automatic escalation to senior technical staff with direct contact information provided.\"*\n\n**CALCULATION IMPROVEMENTS:**\n- **Planned Maintenance Exclusion**: Limited to 4 hours monthly during specified maintenance windows\n- **Partial Outage Recognition**: Service degradation >50% counts as outage\n- **Measurement Transparency**: Real-time monitoring dashboards with third-party verification\n\n**NEGOTIATION TIP**: Frame liquidated damages as \"reasonable pre-estimate of actual losses\" rather than penalties to improve enforceability.\n\nWhat's your average hourly revenue?

Frame it as \"this gives you the chance to fix issues before we look elsewhere.\"\n\n**BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION**: \n\"We're not seeking windfall profits, just compensation that reflects the real impact on our business and incentivizes reliable service.\"\n\nThis positions you as reasonable while securing meaningful protection beyond token service credits.",
