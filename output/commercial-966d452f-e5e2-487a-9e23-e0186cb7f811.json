The vendor is pushing back on our standard DPA terms and wants to include language that they can use our data to \"improve their services and develop new features.\" They're also requesting a broad license to our data. How should I handle this pushback while protecting our customer data and IP?",

Here's my recommended approach:\n\n**Immediate Red Flags:**\n- \"Improve services\" language is often code for training AI models on your data\n- Broad data licenses can create IP ownership issues and competitive risks\n- May violate your own customer privacy commitments\n\n**Counter-proposal Strategy:**\n1. **Limit data use to service delivery only** - \"Vendor may only use Customer Data to provide the contracted Services\"\n2. **Prohibit AI training** - Add explicit language: \"Vendor shall not use Customer Data for machine learning, AI model training, or algorithm development\"\n3. **Allow only aggregated, de-identified analytics** - \"Vendor may create anonymized, aggregated statistics that cannot identify Customer or its users\"\n4. **Sunset clause** - Any permitted uses must cease within 30 days of contract termination\n\n**Risk-based negotiation:**\n- If they refuse all limitations, consider if this vendor is truly necessary\n- Alternative: Require them to process only synthetic/test data during onboarding\n- Escalate to business stakeholders about competitive intelligence risks\n\nWant me to draft specific contract language for these protections?",
