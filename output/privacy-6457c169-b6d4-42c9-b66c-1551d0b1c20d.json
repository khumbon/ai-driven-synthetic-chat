        "content": "\"As long as necessary\" is insufficient under GDPR and creates significant compliance risk. Here's what you need:\n\n**Required Specificity:**\n- Define specific time periods (e.g., \"3 years from contract termination\")\n- Establish clear criteria for determining periods (e.g., \"until legal limitation period expires\")\n- Link retention to specific lawful basis and business purpose\n- Document decision-making rationale for each processing activity\n\n**Acceptable Examples:**\n- \"Employee records: 7 years post-employment (legal compliance requirement)\"\n- \"Marketing data: Until consent withdrawn or 2 years of inactivity\"\n- \"Financial records: 10 years per local accounting standards\"\n\n**Risks of Vague Retention Policies:**\n- Administrative fines up to â‚¬20M or 4% global turnover\n- Increased scrutiny during regulatory investigations\n- Difficulty defending against data subject complaints\n- Challenges responding to erasure requests (Article 17)\n- Potential civil liability in data breach scenarios\n\n**Immediate Action Items:**\n1. Conduct data mapping exercise to identify all processing activities\n2. Engage business units to define legitimate business needs\n3. Consult legal/compliance teams on statutory requirements\n4. Implement automated deletion procedures where possible\n5. Document retention schedule in privacy policies and internal procedures\n\nGiven your size (800 employees), you cannot rely on the small enterprise exemption, making compliance mandatory.",

However, consider notification in these scenarios:\n- **High-risk processing**: New activities involving special categories of data\n- **Cross-border transfers**: New third country transfers without adequacy decisions\n- **Significant changes**: Major business restructuring affecting processing purposes\n- **DPIA triggers**: When updates indicate need for Data Protection Impact Assessment\n\n**Best Practice:**\nEstablish internal escalation procedures to flag when updates might trigger other GDPR obligations (DPIAs, breach notifications, etc.). Consider annual compliance reports to supervisory authorities as relationship-building measure, though not legally required.\n\nThis proactive approach demonstrates accountability principle compliance and reduces regulatory risk.",

Engage qualified EU privacy counsel for TIA\n2. Implement technical safeguards before data transfers begin\n3. Update privacy policies with detailed transfer information\n4. Establish incident response procedures for government requests\n\nAvoid: Derogations under Article 49 (too narrow for ongoing commercial transfers)",
