Key considerations: 1) Your employer's written policy on personal computer use, 2) Whether they've explicitly prohibited personal activities, 3) The scope of monitoring (keystroke logging of personal passwords/communications raises stronger privacy concerns). I'd recommend requesting a detailed written policy specifying exactly what's monitored.

Document everything: project exclusions, supervisor comments, any witnesses, changes in job duties/opportunities. Consider requesting reasonable accommodations in writing to establish your ADA rights.

Illinois courts have recognized that firing employees for asserting statutory privacy rights violates public policy. Key protections: 1) BIPA creates statutory rights that cannot be waived by employment coercion, 2) Wrongful termination claims for firing employees who refuse illegal data collection, 3) Potential retaliation claims under state privacy laws. If they threaten termination, document everything in writing. Send HR an email stating you're willing to use compliant timekeeping systems but cannot consent to BIPA violations without proper statutory disclosures. This creates a paper trail showing you're not refusing to work, but refusing illegal data collection. Many BIPA attorneys handle these cases because the statutory damages and fee-shifting provisions make them economically viable. The threat of termination actually strengthens your case by showing they're using coercive employment pressure to circumvent privacy laws.",
