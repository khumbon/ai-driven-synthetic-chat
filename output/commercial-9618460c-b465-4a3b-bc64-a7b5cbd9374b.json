The vendor is proposing a liability cap equal to 12 months of fees paid, but we're concerned this is too low given the critical nature of their service to our operations. What are some strategies to negotiate better liability protection?",

        "content": "Here are several strategies to strengthen your liability protection:\n\n**1. Carve-outs from the Liability Cap:**\n- Data breaches and security incidents\n- Violations of confidentiality obligations\n- IP infringement claims\n- Gross negligence and willful misconduct\n- Violations of law or regulation\n\n**2. Increase the Cap Amount:**\n- Propose 24-36 months of fees for critical services\n- Consider a minimum floor (e.g., $500K or $1M minimum)\n- Tie the cap to your actual damages exposure\n\n**3. Service Level Agreement (SLA) Credits:**\n- Negotiate separate SLA penalties outside the liability cap\n- Include business interruption coverage for extended outages\n\n**4. Insurance Requirements:**\n- Require vendor to carry adequate E&O and cyber liability insurance\n- Make your company an additional insured on key policies\n\n**Business Justification:**\nEmphasize that a 12-month cap doesn't reflect the true business impact of service failures, especially for mission-critical systems. Would you like me to draft specific contract language for any of these approaches?",
