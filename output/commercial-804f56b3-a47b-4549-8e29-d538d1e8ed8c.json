Several states have banned or severely restricted non-competes, and the FTC has proposed a federal ban (though its implementation remains uncertain). States like California, North Dakota, and Oklahoma generally prohibit non-competes, while others like Massachusetts and Washington have imposed strict limitations (salary thresholds, duration limits, etc.).\n\nFor enforceability, focus on these key elements: (1) reasonable geographic scope tied to your actual market presence, (2) limited duration (typically 6-12 months max), (3) narrow scope covering only legitimate business interests, and (4) adequate consideration (signing bonus, promotion, or specialized training beyond regular salary).\n\nConsider these alternatives that are generally more enforceable: robust non-disclosure agreements covering trade secrets and confidential information, non-solicitation clauses preventing employee/customer poaching (usually 12-24 months), and invention assignment agreements securing IP rights. These often provide similar protection without the enforceability risks of broad non-competes.\n\nWhat state(s) are your employees based in, and what specific competitive activities are you most concerned about?",

Here's a strategic approach:\n\n**For proprietary algorithms and methodologies**: Use comprehensive trade secret agreements rather than relying solely on non-competes. Define what constitutes confidential information, require return of all materials, and include specific acknowledgments about the value and secrecy of your algorithms. This provides stronger, longer-lasting protection.\n\n**For client relationships**: Non-solicitation clauses are often more enforceable than full non-competes. Restrict solicitation of clients the employee personally serviced or learned about through confidential information for 12-18 months. Include both direct and indirect solicitation (through third parties).\n\n**For team recruitment**: Employee non-solicitation clauses preventing recruitment of co-workers for 12-24 months are generally well-received by courts, especially if you can show the employee had access to personnel information, compensation details, or performance data.\n\n**Structure recommendations**: Tier your restrictions based on seniority/access level, provide garden leave or severance during restriction periods, and clearly define what constitutes \"competing business\" (avoid overly broad language). Consider requiring specialized training participants to sign separate agreements with longer restriction periods tied specifically to that investment.\n\nHave you documented the specific value of your training programs and confidential information?

Create detailed records showing: program costs, time invested, proprietary methodologies taught, and how this training creates competitive advantages. This quantifiable investment strengthens enforceability arguments significantly.\n\nFor your client contracts and algorithm development, maintain confidential logs showing: development costs, timeline, key personnel involved, and competitive value. Courts want to see legitimate business interests backed by real investment and potential harm.\n\n**Compensation during restrictions**: While not always required, providing \"garden leave\" (salary continuation) or substantial severance during non-compete periods dramatically improves enforceability. Consider 50-75% salary continuation for 6-12 months, or lump-sum severance equal to 6-9 months salary. This shows the restrictions have real value and aren't punitive.\n\n**Defining competing activities**: Be surgical, not broad. Instead of \"any software company,\" specify: \"companies developing [specific type] algorithms for [your industry sector]\" or \"businesses providing [specific services] to [defined client categories].\" Include geographic limitations tied to where you actually operate or where the employee worked.\n\n**Tiered approach**: Create different restriction levels: C-suite/senior engineers get broader restrictions with higher compensation, mid-level employees get focused non-solicitation with modest severance, junior employees get primarily trade secret protection.\n\nConsider requiring 30-60 days advance notice of new employment with disclosure of job duties - this helps monitoring without being overly restrictive.

The 9% total fee structure (6% + 3%) is on the higher end - ensure you've seen Item 19 financial performance representations and spoken with current franchisees about actual profitability.",

The selective reference approach suggests they're hiding problematic franchisee experiences.\n\nA 23% termination rate over three years is extremely high and should be a major red flag.

This suggests either unrealistic expectations, poor franchisor support, unprofitable business models, or aggressive termination practices.\n\nImmediate action needed: 1) Demand the complete franchisee list as required by law, 2) Contact terminated franchisees from Item 20 to understand why they left, 3) Request Item 21 financial statements and verify franchisor financial stability.
