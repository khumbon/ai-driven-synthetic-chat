        "content": "**This clause is problematic and likely non-compliant** with GDPR processor requirements. Here's why:\n\n**GDPR Article 28 Processor Limitations:**\n- Processors can only process personal data on documented instructions from controller\n- \"Service improvement\" goes beyond your processing purposes\n- Creates independent processing purpose for the vendor\n- Transforms vendor from processor to joint controller or independent controller\n\n**\"Anonymized Data\" Issues:**\n1. **True anonymization is rare** - Often pseudonymized, not anonymized\n2. **Aggregated data risks** - May still be linkable to individuals\n3. **GDPR applies until true anonymization** - Processing occurs before anonymization\n4. **Verification challenge** - How do you verify effective anonymization?\n\n**Recommended Response:**\n**Option 1: Remove the clause entirely**\n- Cleanest approach maintaining processor relationship\n- Vendor processes only for your specified purposes\n\n**Option 2: If clause remains, require:**\n- Separate legal basis analysis (vendor becomes controller)\n- Updated privacy notices mentioning vendor's use\n- Technical proof of effective anonymization\n- Consent mechanism if no other legal basis\n- Joint controller agreement if shared purposes\n\n**Negotiation Points:**\n- \"Service improvement limited to security and performance\"\n- \"Aggregated, non-personal usage statistics only\"\n- \"No use for product enhancement or commercial purposes\"\n- \"Immediate anonymization upon receipt\"\n\n**Bottom Line:** Push back strongly on this clause - it creates unnecessary compliance complexity and risk.",
