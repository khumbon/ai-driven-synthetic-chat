Neither party may claim customer relationship without documentary evidence.\\\"\\n\\n**Anti-Interference Clause:**\\n\\\"Neither party shall make disparaging comments about the other or offer preferential terms to influence customer choice during transition period.\\\"\\n\\n**Revenue Protection:**\\n- **Commission sharing**: If customer chooses distributor, you receive reduced commission for 12 months\\n- **Clawback protection**: If distributor loses customer within 18 months, relationship reverts to you\\n\\n**Documentation Requirements:**\\n- **Customer correspondence**: All communications during transition must be documented\\n- **Joint meeting minutes**: Record customer preferences and concerns\\n\\nThis creates an auditable process that protects both your existing relationships and the distributor's legitimate exclusivity expectations.\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2024-11-22T16:39:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"That's a solid process.
