Document Legal Basis:**\\n- **Specific laws**: Identify exact tax/accounting regulations requiring 7-year retention\\n- **Jurisdiction**: Specify which tax authorities require retention\\n- **Data necessity**: Confirm only transaction data needed for compliance is retained\\n- **Retention schedule**: Automatic deletion after legal retention period expires\\n\\n**2. Data Minimization Approach:**\\n- **Reduce data**: Keep only legally required transaction elements\\n- **Pseudonymization**: Where legally permissible, replace identifiers\\n- **Access restriction**: Limit access to compliance-necessary personnel only\\n- **Purpose limitation**: Use only for legal compliance, not marketing/analytics\\n\\n**Communication Template:**\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Regarding your request to delete transaction history:\\n\\nWe are legally required to retain certain transaction records for 7 years under [specific tax law/regulation]. This includes [specific data elements]. We cannot delete this information during the retention period as it would violate our legal obligations.\\n\\nHowever, we have:\\n- Restricted access to this data to authorized personnel only\\n- Removed it from marketing and analytics processing\\n- Set automatic deletion for [specific date] when the legal retention period expires\\n- Minimized the data to only what's legally required\\n\\nThis exception to your deletion request is permitted under GDPR Article 17(3)(b). You have the right to complain to the supervisory authority if you disagree with this decision.\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Additional Actions:**\\n- **Segregate data**: Move transaction data to separate, restricted system\\n- **Update processing records**: Reflect legal obligation as sole basis\\n- **Monitor retention periods**: Ensure automatic deletion when legal requirement expires\\n- **Supervisory authority guidance**: Check if your DPA has specific guidance on tax law retention\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2024-09-12T13:42:30Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"What format should we use for the data subject access response?
