Send final cure notice citing specific breaches:\n   - \"Chronic SLA violations (97.9% vs. 99.5% required uptime)\"\n   - \"Three data corruption incidents compromising system integrity\"\n   - \"Failure to remediate despite formal notices dated [X] and [Y]\"\n\n2.

Here's your comprehensive assessment:\n\n**Force Majeure Analysis:**\n- Factory fires can qualify if they're truly unforeseeable and beyond the supplier's control\n- Key questions: Was the fire caused by negligence, poor maintenance, or code violations?\n- Courts require the event to be genuinely unpreventable, not just inconvenient or expensive\n- The supplier must prove the fire directly prevents performance (not just makes it more costly)\n\n**Supplier's Obligations Under Force Majeure:**\n- Immediate notice requirement (check if they complied with timing)\n- Duty to mitigate: Must they source from alternative facilities, subcontractors, or expedite rebuilding?\n- Obligation to provide regular updates and estimated restoration timeline\n- Many contracts require exhausting all reasonable alternatives before claiming force majeure\n\n**Your Protective Options:**\n\n**Immediate Actions:**\n- Demand detailed documentation: fire investigation reports, insurance claims, rebuilding timeline\n- Require proof that alternative sourcing is impossible or commercially unreasonable\n- Invoke your right to source elsewhere if they cannot perform\n\n**Contract Remedies:**\n- Review your agreement for 'adequate assurance' clauses allowing you to demand performance guarantees\n- Check for termination rights after extended force majeure periods (typically 60-90 days)\n- Examine whether you can recover additional costs of replacement sourcing\n\n**Business Continuity:**\n- Document all additional costs from supply disruption for potential recovery\n- Notify your customers immediately and review your own force majeure rights\n- Consider emergency sourcing agreements with alternative suppliers\n\nSix months seems excessive unless this is highly specialized manufacturing.
