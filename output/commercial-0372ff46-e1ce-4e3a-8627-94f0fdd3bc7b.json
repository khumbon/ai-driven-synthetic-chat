Key concerns: (1) 'Unlimited internal use' could mean thousands of installations vs. your controlled per-seat model, (2) 'All subsidiaries globally' creates enforcement challenges across multiple jurisdictions, (3) You lose control over usage scaling and compliance monitoring. I recommend: (1) Counter with a 'enterprise-wide license' with defined user caps and annual true-ups, (2) Include audit rights with quarterly usage reports, (3) Structure tiered pricing based on employee count or revenue bands, (4) Add carve-outs for subsidiaries acquired post-contract, (5) Include termination rights if they exceed agreed parameters.

For source code escrow: This involves depositing your source code with a neutral third party (escrow agent) who releases it to the licensee only under specific 'release conditions.' Standard structure: (1) You deposit source code, documentation, and build instructions with escrow agent (Iron Mountain, NCC Group, etc.), (2) Code is updated with each major release, (3) Release triggered only by specific events: your bankruptcy, discontinuation of product, failure to provide support per SLA, or breach of maintenance obligations. Critical protections needed: (1) Narrow release conditions - avoid vague terms like 'business interruption', (2) Cure periods (30-60 days) before release, (3) Licensee can only use code for internal maintenance, not development, (4) Non-disclosure obligations survive escrow release, (5) Verification procedures for deposits. Annual escrow costs typically $5,000-15,000. Shall I draft the escrow agreement terms?",

For client relationships - the most valuable asset: (1) Draft client transition letters jointly, emphasizing continuity of service, (2) Offer clients choice of which partner to continue with, (3) Consider non-compete limitations in your geographic area for 12-18 months, (4) Transfer contracts formally with client consent. For IP division: (1) Catalog all proprietary methodologies, templates, client lists, (2) Consider licensing arrangements where both can use certain IP, (3) Value intellectual property for buyout scenarios.

Recommended dissolution structure: (1) Asset valuation by neutral party for equipment, receivables, (2) Client transition meetings with both partners present, (3) Methodology documentation with clear licensing terms, (4) Non-solicitation agreement (you won't actively recruit each other's clients for 18 months), (5) Revenue sharing for transition period to smooth the split. For the methodology IP specifically, document what each contributed and consider whether certain innovations are truly joint vs. individual - this affects ongoing licensing rights.

The supplier approval clause is particularly concerning as it limits your operational flexibility and potentially increases costs.

Red flags to address: (1) Does the automatic renewal include fee increases? (2) What are termination clauses and penalties? (3) Do you have territorial protection?

However, 8 ongoing lawsuits is concerning and indicates systemic issues. Key investigation areas: (1) Review litigation details in FDD Item 3 - are suits about territory disputes, fee disagreements, or operational support failures? (2) Contact current and former franchisees directly - FDD Item 20 lists contacts, (3) Analyze financial performance representations in Item 19 - are projections realistic? The $70,000 total upfront ($45K franchise + $25K technology) is high-end but not unusual for established food service franchises. However, question the 'technology fee' - what specific technology/systems does this cover, and are there ongoing tech support fees? Critical next steps: (1) Hire a franchise attorney to review FDD thoroughly, (2) Request to speak with franchisees involved in current litigation, (3) Demand detailed breakdown of what technology fee covers, (4) Get 3-year financial projections in writing with assumptions, (5) Negotiate performance guarantees - if franchisor support doesn't meet promises, you need exit clauses. The combination of high fees, restrictive terms, and litigation pattern suggests finding a different franchise opportunity might be wise. What specific technology systems justify the $25,000 fee?",

        "content": "Non-compete enforceability varies significantly by state and specific terms. A 2-year statewide restriction is likely overly broad in most jurisdictions - courts typically require reasonable geographic scope, duration, and industry limitation. Key enforceability factors: (1) Geographic scope - statewide is often considered excessive unless you had statewide responsibilities, (2) Duration - 2 years is long; 6-12 months more commonly enforced, (3) Industry scope - 'all related industries' is probably too vague and broad, (4) Legitimate business interests - must protect trade secrets, customer relationships, or specialized training, not just prevent competition. Your strategic development work could support enforcement if it involved: confidential processes, customer lists, pricing strategies, or proprietary methods. However, if strategies were based on general industry knowledge or collaborative development, enforceability weakens. Critical analysis needed: (1) What state governs your contract? (2) What exactly constitutes 'related industries'? (3) Did you sign this recently or years ago? (courts increasingly scrutinize broad restrictions), (4) What's your geographic territory of responsibility? Before accepting the offer, I'd recommend getting an independent legal opinion on enforceability in your specific jurisdiction, rather than relying solely on the new employer's legal coverage promise.",

        "content": "Texas significantly changes the analysis - it's more employer-friendly on non-competes than many states. The 4-state regional responsibility strengthens the geographic scope argument, though statewide restriction may still be excessive. However, Texas courts do enforce reasonable non-competes when they protect legitimate business interests. Your situation has mixed enforceability factors: Stronger enforcement likelihood: (1) Texas jurisdiction favors reasonable restrictions, (2) Your multi-state client management role supports broader geographic scope, (3) 3-year-old contract suggests you received consideration (job/promotion) for the restriction, (4) Client relationships are protectable business interests. Weaker enforcement factors: (1) 2-year duration is still long, even in Texas, (2) 'All related industries' remains vague - logistics, supply chain, and freight brokerage could encompass too much, (3) Statewide vs. your 4-state region creates geographic mismatch. Texas courts apply a 'reasonableness' test weighing your right to work against employer's business interests. Strategy recommendation: (1) Get Texas employment law counsel opinion immediately, (2) Document which clients/strategies you developed vs. inherited, (3) Analyze if new role would actually compete for same clients, (4) Consider negotiating with current employer for release or modification. The legal cost coverage from new employer is helpful, but Texas non-compete litigation can be expensive and lengthy.

Key legal requirements for valid force majeure: (1) Event must be specifically covered by contract language, (2) Event must be unforeseeable and beyond their control, (3) Event must directly prevent performance, not just make it more expensive, (4) Proper notice procedures must be followed, (5) Supplier must demonstrate mitigation efforts. Critical analysis points: (1) Does their contract specifically list 'flooding' or use broader terms like 'natural disasters'?

This suggests they have production capacity but are choosing not to fulfill your contract for economic reasons. Key legal violations: (1) Force majeure requires inability to perform, not selective performance, (2) Offering same products elsewhere proves production capability exists, (3) Higher pricing suggests economic motivation rather than genuine impossibility, (4) This likely constitutes breach of contract and breach of good faith dealing. Immediate action items: (1) Document evidence of their sales to other buyers - screenshots, price lists, delivery confirmations, (2) Send formal notice rejecting their force majeure claim with specific evidence, (3) Demand immediate performance within reasonable cure period (5-10 days), (4) Calculate damages from production shutdown and lost customer contracts, (5) Issue formal breach notice if they don't cure. Legal remedies available: (1) Damages for cover costs (difference between their price and replacement supplier), (2) Consequential damages from lost customer contracts, (3) Specific performance if goods are unique, (4) Potential bad faith/fraud claims for misrepresenting force majeure. The 2-day notice delay might also violate notice requirements, but their selective performance is the stronger argument. Have you documented their sales to other buyers with dates and pricing?
