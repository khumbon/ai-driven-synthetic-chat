Extend Notice Period**: Push for 90-180 days notice for convenience termination to give you adequate time to transition to alternatives.\n\n**2. Mutual Termination Rights**: Ensure termination for convenience is mutual - if they can terminate with notice, so can you.\n\n**3. Carve-out for Cause**: Distinguish between termination for cause vs. convenience. For cause should require material breach with cure period.\n\n**4. Transition Assistance**: Negotiate mandatory transition services at standard rates for 30-90 days post-termination.\n\n**5. Data Export Rights**: Require vendor to provide data in standard formats and assist with migration.\n\n**6. Survival of Critical Terms**: Ensure data access, confidentiality, and IP provisions survive termination.\n\nGiven your operational dependency, I'd also suggest negotiating a \"business continuity\" clause that prevents termination during critical business periods (like fiscal year-end) except for material breach.",

Common product liability exclusions include intentional acts, design defects (if excluded), failure to warn, or claims outside the policy period. However, the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify - they must defend even if coverage is questionable. Since you're well within policy limits, their delay is concerning. Send a formal written demand referencing the specific policy language requiring defense, and set a reasonable deadline (10-15 days). If they continue to delay, they may be acting in bad faith, which can expose them to extra-contractual damages. Consider retaining coverage counsel (separate from defense counsel) to protect your interests against the insurer. Document any damages you're suffering from their delay. Have they provided any written explanation for the delay, or identified specific coverage issues?",

Copy this letter to the insurer's coverage counsel if known. Simultaneously, identify and be prepared to retain qualified product liability defense counsel - get fee agreements ready. If the insurer doesn't respond immediately, hire counsel and file the response to preserve your rights. Keep detailed records of all costs incurred due to their delay. The insurer's failure to provide timely defense may constitute bad faith, potentially making them liable for all damages including amounts exceeding policy limits. Consider engaging an insurance coverage attorney immediately to put additional pressure on the insurer and preserve your bad faith claims. Missing the deadline could be catastrophic - protecting against default is your top priority right now.",

First, review your franchise agreement's termination provisions - what constitutes material breach, cure periods, and notice requirements. Many franchise agreements require specific cure periods (typically 10-30 days) for certain breaches. Document everything related to your complaints about supplier requirements and the timeline of events leading to termination. Retaliation claims can be powerful if you can establish causation between protected complaints and adverse action. Check if your complaints involved food safety, labor law violations, or other protected activities. State franchise laws often provide additional protections beyond your agreement - many require 'good cause' for termination and fair dealing. You may have claims for wrongful termination, breach of implied covenant of good faith, and potentially tortious interference with business relationships.

If they're providing a cure period, they generally cannot simultaneously demand you cease trademark use, as that would make cure impossible - you can't operate the franchise to demonstrate compliance without using their trademarks. This contradiction suggests either bad faith or confusion on their part. Your photos and satisfactory inspection records are valuable evidence of compliance. Immediately respond in writing acknowledging the cure period and your intent to cure (even if you believe you're already compliant), while noting the contradictory trademark demand. Continue operating during the cure period unless your agreement specifically allows trademark suspension. Document your ongoing compliance efforts daily with photos and records. The contradiction may indicate they don't actually want to allow cure, supporting a wrongful termination claim. Consider whether this pattern fits with other franchisees - class action opportunities sometimes exist. Have you consulted your franchise agreement about what happens to inventory, equipment, and lease rights if terminated?

Non-compete clauses are increasingly scrutinized - courts examine geographic scope, time duration, and reasonableness given your investment and circumstances. A 5-mile radius might be reasonable for one location but potentially excessive when applied to three locations, especially if it creates overlapping restricted areas that effectively bar you from the entire market. The 2-year duration is typically enforceable if reasonable in scope. Forced inventory buyback at cost could be challenged if it's punitive rather than protective of legitimate business interests, especially if inventory has appreciated or if you're being wrongfully terminated. If the termination is wrongful, these provisions may be unenforceable as penalty clauses. Some courts won't enforce restrictive covenants when the franchisor terminates without proper cause. Your substantial investment in three locations strengthens arguments against enforcement. Consider whether you have grounds for preliminary injunctive relief to maintain operations during litigation. The economic devastation you'd face supports urgency in challenging the termination itself rather than just the post-termination restrictions.",
