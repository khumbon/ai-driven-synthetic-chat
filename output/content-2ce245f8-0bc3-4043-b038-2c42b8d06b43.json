Background IP:\\n   - Each party retains ownership of pre-existing IP\\n   - Cross-license for project use only\\n   - No rights to exploit outside the collaboration\\n\\n2. Joint Developments:\\n   - Jointly owned by both parties\\n   - Equal rights to use, license, and enforce\\n   - Revenue sharing agreement for third-party licensing\\n\\n3. Derivative Works:\\n   - Improvements to Background IP owned by original owner\\n   - Other party gets limited license for project purposes\\n   - Clear criteria for what constitutes \\\"improvement\\\" vs. new IP\\n\\n4. Solely Developed:\\n   - Created by one party using only their resources\\n   - Owned by creating party\\n   - License to other party for project integration\\n```\\n\\n**Key Structural Decisions:**\\n- **Revenue Sharing:** 50/50 split on joint IP licensing?\\n- **Field of Use:** Any restrictions on where each party can use joint IP?\\n- **Commercialization Rights:** Can either party commercialize independently?\\n- **Third-Party Licensing:** Joint approval required or independent rights?\\n\\nWhat's the relative contribution level expected from each party?
