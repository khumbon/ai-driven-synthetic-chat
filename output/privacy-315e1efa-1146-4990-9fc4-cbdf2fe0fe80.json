Unconscionability Arguments:**\n- Retroactive application to existing footage\n- No meaningful choice or ability to negotiate\n- Fundamental privacy expectations vs. commercial interests\n\n**Evidence to Gather:**\n- Email records showing no notification\n- Original terms vs. current terms comparison\n- Timeline of when changes allegedly occurred\n- Screenshot of how changes were supposedly communicated\n\n**Challenging \"Emergency Exception\" Defense:**\n\n**1. Emergency Exception is Very Narrow:**\n- Must be **imminent threat** to life/safety\n- **Hot pursuit** or immediate danger situations\n- Cannot be routine investigations or fishing expeditions\n- Police must still document exigent circumstances\n\n**2. Request Documentation:**\n- FOIA requests for police records showing:\n  - Nature of each \"emergency\"\n  - Timeline of requests\n  - Justification for bypassing warrant requirement\n  - How footage was actually used\n\n**3. Constitutional Challenges:**\n- **Carpenter v. US** principles apply to location/routine data\n- Private property surveillance requires higher scrutiny\n- Pattern of requests suggests systematic access, not emergencies\n\n**Strategic Litigation Approach:**\n- Challenge each police request's emergency justification\n- Argue terms changes are unconscionable/invalid\n- Seek injunctive relief to stop future sharing\n- Demand audit of all data sharing instances\n\nThe combination of inadequate notice and questionable emergency claims strengthens your privacy violation case significantly.",
