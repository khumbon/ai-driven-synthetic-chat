        "content": "Here's the risk analysis for increasing your liability cap from 12 to 24 months:\n\n**Financial Impact:**\n- Current cap: $500K (12 months)\n- Proposed cap: $1M (24 months)\n- Additional exposure: $500K\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Healthcare data breaches can result in significant regulatory fines and class action lawsuits\n- HIPAA violations carry penalties up to $2M per incident\n- Given healthcare context, actual damages could exceed the cap anyway\n\n**Negotiation Strategy:**\n1. **Counter-offer 18 months** as a compromise position\n2. **Carve-out exceptions** - exclude data breaches and IP infringement from the cap\n3. **Add insurance requirement** - require client to maintain cyber liability insurance\n4. **Tiered structure** - 12 months for general claims, 24 months only for security-related issues\n\n**Alternative approaches:**\n- Offer the 24-month cap in exchange for a 3-year term commitment\n- Include a liability reduction clause if they implement recommended security measures\n\nGiven the healthcare context and contract value, 18 months with proper carve-outs might be the sweet spot that shows flexibility while managing risk.",

        "content": "**Mutual indemnification can work, but structure it carefully:**\n\n**Standard Mutual Indemnification Framework:**\n\n**You indemnify them for:**\n- IP infringement claims related to your software\n- Violations of applicable laws in providing the service\n- Gross negligence or willful misconduct\n\n**They indemnify you for:**\n- Claims arising from their data/content uploaded to the system\n- Their violation of the acceptable use policy\n- Claims related to their use of the service outside the scope of the agreement\n- Third-party claims related to their business operations\n\n**Key Protective Provisions:**\n1. **Notice requirements** - Must provide prompt written notice of claims\n2. **Control of defense** - Indemnifying party controls defense and settlement\n3. **Cooperation requirement** - Indemnified party must reasonably cooperate\n4. **No settlement without consent** - Neither party can settle without the other's approval\n5. **Mitigation obligation** - Both parties must take reasonable steps to minimize damages\n\n**Critical Exclusions:**\n- Exclude indemnification for regulatory fines/penalties (especially HIPAA)\n- Exclude punitive damages\n- Exclude claims arising from modifications they make to your software\n\n**Insurance backstop:**\nRequire them to maintain general liability insurance ($2M+) and cyber liability coverage\n\nMutual indemnification is increasingly common in enterprise deals and shows good faith, but the scope and limitations are everything.",
