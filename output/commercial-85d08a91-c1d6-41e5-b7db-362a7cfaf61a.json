Here's a strategic approach:\n\n**Negotiation Strategy:**\n1. **Tiered Liability Structure**: Propose different caps for different types of damages (e.g., $50K for general damages, $250K for data loss/security breaches)\n2. **Percentage-Based Caps**: Suggest caps based on 12-24 months of fees paid, which scales with your investment\n3. **Carve-outs**: Exclude certain scenarios from caps entirely (IP infringement, data breaches, willful misconduct)\n\n**Key Arguments to Present:**\n- Your business dependency on their service\n- Industry standard caps (typically 12-24 months of fees)\n- Specific risks in your industry that require higher protection\n- Your willingness to pay slightly higher fees for better liability terms\n\n**Fallback Positions:**\n- If they won't budge on caps, negotiate for comprehensive insurance requirements\n- Add service level agreements with meaningful penalties\n- Include detailed data recovery and business continuity obligations\n\nWhat's your annual contract value and industry?

For shareholder approval, you absolutely need consent from all current shareholders (founders and angels) to establish the equity pool and adopt the plan, as it dilutes their ownership. Most investment agreements require supermajority or unanimous consent for equity plan adoption. Document this through written consents or formal shareholder meeting resolutions.",

        "content": "Equity pool size varies by stage and industry, but 10-15% is reasonable for early-stage startups, though 8-12% might be more palatable to investors. Consider these negotiation strategies: 1) Present detailed hiring plans showing specific roles and estimated option grants to justify the pool size, 2) Propose a smaller initial pool (8-10%) with board approval rights for future expansions, 3) Offer to increase the pool from a future funding round rather than current cap table. Regarding anti-dilution provisions, most angel agreements contain weighted-average anti-dilution protection, but employee option pools typically don't trigger these provisions if they're established pre-investment or specifically carved out. Review the investment agreement language carefully - some broadly-written anti-dilution clauses might inadvertently cover option grants. Consider proposing that the equity pool be established 'above' the angel investment (increasing pre-money valuation accordingly) rather than diluting all parties proportionally. This addresses their dilution concerns while maintaining your hiring flexibility.",

As master tenant, you generally remain primarily liable to the landlord for: 1) All rent and operating expenses for the entire premises, 2) Compliance with lease covenants and maintenance obligations, 3) Any damages caused by the subtenant. Key considerations: The landlord cannot unreasonably withhold consent unless your lease allows discretionary approval. Personal guarantees from subtenant principals provide additional security but may make the deal less attractive. Since your sublease term (2+ years) is shorter than your remaining lease term (3 years), you'll need provisions addressing what happens if the subtenant doesn't extend. Consider requiring the subtenant to provide security deposits, insurance naming you as additional insured, and indemnification clauses. Review whether your lease permits assignment as an alternative - assignments typically transfer primary liability to the assignee.",

        "content": "Regarding tenant improvements: You need clear contractual provisions addressing who owns improvements, maintenance responsibilities, and restoration obligations. Typically structure it so: 1) Subtenant obtains all improvement permits and landlord approvals directly, 2) Sublease requires subtenant to remove their improvements and restore to condition existing when they took occupancy, 3) You retain right to approve improvements that might affect your restoration obligations to the landlord, 4) Subtenant provides additional security deposit for removal costs. Get landlord consent for subtenant improvements in writing to avoid later disputes.\n\nRegarding recapture: Many leases contain recapture clauses allowing landlords to reclaim space instead of approving subleases/assignments. If your lease includes this provision, the landlord can typically recapture the portion you want to sublease, effectively reducing your lease size and rent proportionally. This might actually benefit you by eliminating ongoing liability for that space, though you'd lose sublease income. Review your lease language carefully - some recapture clauses require the landlord to pay you market-rate compensation for improvements or early termination costs.",
