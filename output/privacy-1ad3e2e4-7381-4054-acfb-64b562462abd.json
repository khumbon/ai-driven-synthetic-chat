Under HIPAA, healthcare providers must implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosures of protected health information (PHI). You have several legal options: 1) File a complaint with the HHS Office for Civil Rights, which can investigate and impose penalties up to $1.5 million per incident, 2) Demand the provider retrieve or confirm destruction of your records from the wrong recipient, 3) Request a detailed incident report and their remedial action plan, and 4) Consider consulting with a privacy attorney about potential civil remedies, especially given the sensitive mental health information involved.

Their claim of 'confidentiality' regarding their internal investigation is not a valid reason to withhold information you're entitled to under federal law. Additionally, accepting a verbal promise from the wrong recipient without written confirmation of destruction is inadequate remediation. You should formally request in writing: 1) The required breach notification letter, 2) Written confirmation that your records have been retrieved or destroyed, 3) Details of their corrective action plan, and 4) Any identity monitoring services they'll provide. If they continue to refuse, this strengthens your case for both an OCR complaint and potential civil action. The inadequate response itself may constitute an additional violation.",

Key considerations: 1) Break rooms may be considered areas where employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy, especially during personal time, 2) Audio surveillance of conversations is particularly problematic under California's two-party consent wiretapping laws, 3) The employer must demonstrate a legitimate business need that outweighs privacy interests, and 4) California courts apply a balancing test considering the invasion's nature, the employer's justification, and available alternatives. You should document: whether the cameras record audio, if employees were notified in advance, what security incidents (if any) justified the installation, and whether less invasive measures were considered. Consider filing a complaint with the California Labor Commissioner and consulting with an employment attorney.

You should immediately: 1) File an Unfair Labor Practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board - this is time-sensitive, 2) Document who made the admission about monitoring union conversations and when, 3) Preserve any evidence of the surveillance system and its capabilities, 4) Contact the California Labor Commissioner about the privacy violations, and 5) Consider reaching out to a labor attorney who handles both employment and privacy issues. The NLRB can order removal of cameras and other remedies if they find the surveillance was used to chill organizing activities.

Given your substantial losses - credit repair costs, lost home loan opportunity, lost wages, and ongoing credit impact - you should seriously consider pursuing an individual lawsuit rather than relying on class action recovery. Your damages include: 1) Economic losses (credit repair services, lost wages), 2) Consequential damages (lost home loan opportunity), 3) Ongoing harm (continued credit score impact), and 4) Time and effort damages. Document everything: the connection between specific fraudulent accounts and the breached data, financial impact of the lost home loan (higher interest rates, lost opportunity costs), all remediation expenses, and wage losses from time off work. You'll want to consult with a data privacy attorney who handles individual breach cases - many work on contingency for substantial damages. Also preserve evidence that the company's monitoring service was inadequate by failing to detect fraud that should have been caught. Consider whether you can opt out of any class action settlements to preserve your right to individual action.

The Illinois Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act specifically prohibits employers from requesting social media passwords, and Illinois courts have been increasingly skeptical of non-compete agreements. You should not ignore their demand, but you shouldn't comply with the password request either. Instead, respond strategically: 1) Cite the Illinois Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act (820 ILCS 55/) which makes their password demand illegal, 2) Address their non-compete concerns separately - offering to provide specific posts about your job change while maintaining your privacy rights, 3) Note that simply announcing a new job on LinkedIn likely doesn't violate non-compete terms, which typically restrict solicitation and use of confidential information, not employment itself. Draft a written response (or have an attorney do it) that refuses the password demand based on Illinois law while offering reasonable alternatives like providing screenshots of relevant posts. Also consider whether your non-compete is even enforceable - Illinois recently passed legislation significantly restricting non-compete agreements, especially for workers earning less than $75,000 annually. Given their 10-day deadline and legal threats, consulting with an Illinois employment attorney quickly would be wise to ensure your response is properly crafted and to evaluate the enforceability of your non-compete.",
