This demonstrates proactive compliance and due diligence.\n\nDo you need help creating a template for conducting transfer impact assessments for these vendors?",

Verify each vendor's DPF certification status on the official list\n2. Keep SCCs as backup safeguard (belt-and-suspenders approach)\n3. Monitor DPF developments - adequacy decisions can be challenged/revoked\n\nWould you like me to help you verify the DPF certification status of your specific vendors?",
