Under GDPR Article 28, processors can only process personal data on documented instructions from the controller. \"Service improvement and analytics\" using customer data raises several red flags:\n\n**Key Issues:**\n1. **Purpose Limitation (Art. 5(1)(b))** - Processing beyond original purpose requires separate legal basis\n2. **Processor Obligations (Art. 28(3))** - Processor cannot determine purposes/means of processing\n3. **Data Minimization (Art. 5(1)(c))** - Analytics may involve processing more data than necessary\n\n**Suggested Alternative Language:**\n\"Processor shall only process Personal Data: (a) in accordance with Controller's documented instructions; (b) to provide the Services as specified in the Agreement; (c) as required by applicable law. Processor shall not use Personal Data for any other purpose, including service improvement, analytics, or benchmarking, without Controller's prior written consent and appropriate legal basis.\"\n\n**Additional Safeguards to Include:**\n- Data anonymization requirements if any analytics are permitted\n- Explicit prohibition on combining your data with other customers' data\n- Clear data retention and deletion obligations\n\nWould you like me to help draft specific contractual protections for any limited analytics they might legitimately need?",
