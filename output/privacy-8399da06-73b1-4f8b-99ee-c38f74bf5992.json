Legal Basis & Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**\n- Establish clear legal basis (likely Article 6(1)(b) for contract performance or 6(1)(f) for legitimate interests)\n- Execute comprehensive DPAs with EU clients defining roles, responsibilities, and processing purposes\n- Include mandatory clauses per Article 28 GDPR\n\n**2. Cross-Border Transfer Mechanisms**\n- Implement Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for EU-US data transfers\n- Conduct Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs) to evaluate US surveillance laws\n- Consider additional safeguards like encryption and access controls\n\n**3. Technical & Organizational Measures**\n- Data encryption in transit and at rest\n- Role-based access controls and audit logging\n- Regular security assessments and incident response procedures\n\n**4. Individual Rights Infrastructure**\n- Systems to handle data subject requests (access, rectification, erasure, portability)\n- 30-day response timeframe capability\n- Identity verification procedures\n\n**5. Governance Requirements**\n- GDPR-compliant privacy policy and data retention schedules\n- Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk processing\n- Consider appointing an EU representative per Article 27\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific area or discuss implementation priorities?",
