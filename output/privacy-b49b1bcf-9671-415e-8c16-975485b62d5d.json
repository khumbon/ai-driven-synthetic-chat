The 'explicit consent' requirement for special category data is higher than regular Article 6 consent - it must be specific, informed, and unambiguous with clear affirmative action. However, you can improve UX while maintaining compliance: implement granular consent allowing users to choose authentication methods, use clear layered privacy notices, consider consent renewal strategies, and ensure easy withdrawal mechanisms. Alternative approach: redesign your system to avoid Article 9 classification - if you process biometric templates in a way that doesn't uniquely identify individuals (though this is technically challenging), you might argue it's not 'biometric data for unique identification.'
