Here's a framework:\n\n**Qualifying Criteria for Upstream Events:**\n1. **Critical Supplier Definition**: Suppliers providing >20% of essential materials with no substitute available within 60 days\n2. **Single Points of Failure**: Relief only for truly irreplaceable suppliers, not convenient preferred vendors\n3. **Alternative Sourcing Test**: Must demonstrate good faith efforts to secure alternatives (at reasonable cost premium)\n4. **Notice Requirements**: Immediate notification when key suppliers indicate potential disruption\n\n**Verification Requirements:**\n5. **Supplier Chain Mapping**: Annual disclosure of critical upstream dependencies\n6. **Documentation Package**:\n   - Force majeure notice from upstream supplier\n   - Evidence of their facility/operational impact\n   - Records of alternative sourcing attempts\n   - Market availability analysis for substitute materials\n7. **Third-Party Validation**: Industry reports confirming widespread disruption to specific materials/regions\n\n**Shared Sacrifice for Upstream Issues:**\n8. **Allocation Fairness**: If upstream supplier has limited capacity, your supplier must allocate proportionally among all customers\n9. **New Customer Restriction**: Can't take new customers requiring same constrained materials\n10. **Price Protection**: Can't use scarcity to renegotiate pricing with existing customers\n11. **Recovery Commitment**: First priority for materials when upstream supplier recovers\n\n**Mitigation Requirements:**\n12. **Supplier Diversification**: Multi-source critical materials going forward\n13. **Inventory Buffers**: Maintain strategic reserves of critical inputs\n14. **Supply Chain Insurance**: Consider parametric insurance for key material categories\n\nHow many tiers deep do you want visibility? Some companies now require mapping 3-4 levels upstream for critical materials.",

Here's a comprehensive framework:\n\n**Escrow Materials - What Goes In:**\n1. **Complete Source Code**: All source code, including customizations and configurations\n2. **Technical Documentation**: Architecture diagrams, database schemas, API documentation\n3. **Build Instructions**: Step-by-step compilation and deployment procedures\n4. **Dependencies**: Third-party libraries, tools, and runtime requirements\n5. **Test Data**: Sample datasets and testing procedures\n6. **Maintenance History**: Bug fixes, patches, and update procedures\n\n**Release Conditions - When You Get Access:**\n7. **Bankruptcy/Insolvency**: Automatic release upon vendor's financial distress\n8. **Business Cessation**: Vendor stops supporting or developing the software\n9. **Material Breach**: Failure to provide critical support or updates for 60+ days\n10. **Acquisition**: Release if vendor acquired by competitor or hostile entity\n11. **Key Personnel**: Departure of critical development team members\n\n**Verification Requirements:**\n12. **Quarterly Deposits**: Regular updates to ensure currency\n13. **Verification Testing**: Annual compilation tests to ensure materials are complete\n14. **Documentation Updates**: Concurrent updates with each software release\n15. **Independent Review**: Third-party technical review of escrowed materials\n\nWho's your preferred escrow agent? The big three (Iron Mountain, NCC, Codekeeper) have different strengths and fee structures.",

Here's how to find middle ground:\n\n**Compromise Deposit Schedule:**\n1. **Event-Triggered Updates**: Deposits required within 30 days of:\n   - Major releases or version updates\n   - Security patches or critical bug fixes\n   - Architecture changes or new modules\n   - Changes to development team or key personnel\n\n2. **Hybrid Approach**: \n   - Semi-annual full deposits (compromise from quarterly)\n   - Incremental deposits for significant changes between cycles\n   - Annual verification testing with make-good requirements\n\n**Cost-Sharing Solutions:**\n3. **Shared Escrow Costs**: You pay 70-80% since you're the primary beneficiary\n4. **Multi-Customer Escrow**: If vendor has other major clients, share costs across user base\n5. **Simplified Process**: Use automated deposit tools to reduce vendor's administrative burden\n\n**Enhanced Verification:**\n6. **Compilation Testing**: Semi-annual build tests (not just storage)\n7. **Completeness Audit**: Annual technical review of materials\n8. **Gap Analysis**: Document any missing components for quick remedy\n\n**Alternative Protections:**\n- **Inspection Rights**: Quarterly access to review code in secure environment\n- **Dual Custody**: Vendor maintains copy, escrow agent holds verification materials\n- **Insurance Supplement**: Technology E&O policy covering software unavailability\n\nGiven it's ERP, what's your tolerance for system downtime if you needed to reconstruct from escrow?

Here's how to address their proprietary concerns while ensuring rapid recovery:\n\n**Technical Requirements for Fast Recovery:**\n1. **Complete Database Package**: Schemas, stored procedures, triggers, indexes - absolutely non-negotiable for ERP\n2. **API Documentation**: Essential for integrations with other systems\n3. **Configuration Files**: All system configurations, user roles, workflow definitions\n4. **Installation Scripts**: Automated deployment procedures to minimize setup time\n5. **Environment Specifications**: Hardware/software requirements, network configurations\n\n**Addressing Vendor's Proprietary Concerns:**\n6. **Enhanced Escrow Security**: Higher-tier vault access with biometric controls\n7. **Limited Release Rights**: You can use materials only for business continuity, not competitive purposes\n8. **Non-Disclosure Extension**: NDA covers anyone accessing escrowed materials\n9. **Destruction Clauses**: Must destroy materials if vendor relationship resumes\n10. **Time Limitations**: Rights to materials expire after vendor unavailability ends\n\n**Rapid Recovery Framework:**\n11. **Pre-Staged Environment**: Escrow includes VM images or container configurations\n12. **Recovery Testing**: Annual disaster recovery drill using escrowed materials\n13. **Technical Support**: Access to vendor's technical team during transition (if available)\n14. **Professional Services**: Pre-negotiated rates for emergency implementation assistance\n\n**Deal Structure Alternative:**\n- Offer revenue sharing: If you successfully commercialize their IP from escrow, they get percentage\n- Time-limited exclusivity: Enhanced protections for first 2-3 years, then standard escrow\n\nWithout database schemas, you're looking at weeks of reconstruction time. Is the vendor willing to walk away over this issue?",
