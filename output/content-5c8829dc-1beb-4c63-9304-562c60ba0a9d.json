Required Consent Types:**\\n```javascript\\n// Basic implementation\\ngtag('consent', 'default', {\\n  'ad_storage': 'denied',           // Marketing/advertising cookies\\n  'ad_user_data': 'denied',        // NEW: User data for advertising\\n  'ad_personalization': 'denied',   // NEW: Personalized advertising\\n  'analytics_storage': 'denied',    // Analytics cookies\\n  'functionality_storage': 'granted', // Usually granted (functional cookies)\\n  'personalization_storage': 'denied', // Personalization features\\n  'security_storage': 'granted'     // Security-related storage\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**2. Dynamic Consent Updates:**\\n```javascript\\n// When user grants consent\\ngtag('consent', 'update', {\\n  'ad_storage': 'granted',\\n  'ad_user_data': 'granted',\\n  'ad_personalization': 'granted',\\n  'analytics_storage': 'granted',\\n  'personalization_storage': 'granted'\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**Implementation Steps:**\\n\\n**1. CMP Integration:**\\n- Deploy consent banner BEFORE Google tags load\\n- Ensure CMP can communicate with Google's consent framework\\n- Popular compatible CMPs: OneTrust, Cookiebot, CookieYes\\n\\n**2. GA4 Configuration:**\\n```\\n- Enable \\\"Google signals\\\" only with ad_storage consent\\n- Configure \\\"Enhanced conversions\\\" with proper consent gating\\n- Set up conversion modeling in GA4 interface\\n- Enable \\\"Blended data\\\" reporting\\n```\\n\\n**3. Google Ads Integration:**\\n- Link GA4 and Google Ads accounts\\n- Enable conversion import with consent mode data\\n- Set up Enhanced Conversions for web\\n\\n**Impact on Data Collection & Reporting:**\\n\\n**With Consent (Granted State):**\\n- Full data collection and attribution\\n- Individual user tracking\\n- Complete conversion attribution\\n- Detailed audience insights\\n\\n**Without Consent (Denied State):**\\n- **Aggregated measurements** only\\n- **Conversion modeling** fills gaps using machine learning\\n- **Cookieless pings** for basic traffic measurement\\n- **Behavioral modeling** for conversion attribution\\n- **Reduced accuracy** (Google estimates 70-80% accuracy)\\n\\n**Reporting Accuracy Considerations:**\\n\\n**Expected Changes:**\\n- **10-30% reduction** in reported conversions initially\\n- **Attribution accuracy** decreases for denied users\\n- **Audience sizes** appear smaller in advertising platforms\\n- **Cross-device tracking** significantly reduced\\n\\n**Optimization Strategies:**\\n- **First-party data integration** via Customer Match\\n- **Server-side tracking** for critical events\\n- **Enhanced conversions** using hashed customer data\\n- **Offline conversion imports** for complete attribution\\n\\n**Compliance Benefits:**\\n- **Legal compliance** with EU privacy laws\\n- **Reduced regulatory risk** for Google services\\n- **Maintained advertising capabilities** (albeit reduced)\\n- **Future-proofing** for cookieless advertising\\n\\n**Testing & Validation:**\\n- Use Google Tag Assistant to verify implementation\\n- Test both consent granted/denied scenarios\\n- Monitor GA4 data quality reports\\n- Compare pre/post implementation metrics\\n\\nNeed help with specific CMP integration or measuring the impact on your conversion tracking?\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-25T16:42:00Z\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"category\": \"privacy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"privacy_chat_7\",\n    \"title\": \"Vendor Due Diligence for Data Processing\",\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"We're evaluating a new CRM vendor that will process customer data including contact information, interaction history, and behavioral analytics.
