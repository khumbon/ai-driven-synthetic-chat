Review your employee handbook for monitoring policies\n2. Check if your state requires notification (California, Connecticut, Delaware have strict requirements)\n3. Document any health impacts from restricted breaks\n4. Consider collective action with coworkers\n\nDo you have an employee handbook that addresses monitoring, and are you in a union environment?",

Both the employer and your ex-husband face serious liability.",
