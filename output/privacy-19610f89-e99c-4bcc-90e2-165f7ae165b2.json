The strongest cases involve accessing personal passwords, private communications, or medical information. Keep detailed records of what personal information was accessed and when.

However, continued delay could create liability. You have good faith defense if you report promptly now. **Mitigating factors:** You're taking appropriate action upon discovery, and the law protects employees who report in good faith even if some time has passed. **Immediate action needed:** Report today to maximize your legal protections and minimize any potential personal exposure.

Practical steps: consider geo-blocking certain jurisdictions during data collection, prioritize content from countries with more permissive research/commercial use exceptions, and be aware that some countries (like Germany) have stronger publisher rights.

Best practices: create separate user profiles for personal use on company devices, provide advance notice of monitoring schedule, establish data retention limits (30-90 days unless needed for specific investigation), and designate limited personnel with access to monitoring data.

Immediate steps: review your CBA for surveillance/monitoring clauses, technology implementation procedures, and management rights provisions. If monitoring isn't explicitly covered, you'll likely need to: provide advance notice to union representatives, engage in good faith bargaining about implementation, consider union proposals for alternative approaches or limitations.
