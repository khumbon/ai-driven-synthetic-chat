Here's why and how to address it:\n\n**Problems with Split IP Governance:**\n- Different copyright terms (US: life+70, UK: life+70 but different moral rights)\n- Conflicting fair use/fair dealing standards\n- Complex enforcement when IP elements are integrated\n- Unclear rights for derivative works spanning both systems\n\n**Unified Approach Recommendation:**\n*\"All intellectual property created under this Agreement, regardless of creator, shall be governed by [Your State] law, with the following carve-outs: (i) Vendor's pre-existing IP remains under UK law, (ii) moral rights (where applicable) governed by creator's jurisdiction.\"*\n\n**Alternative Framework - Functional Split:**\n*\"IP governance determined by ownership rather than creator:*\n- *Customer-owned work product: [Your State] law*\n- *Vendor-retained tools/methodologies: UK law*\n- *Joint works: [Your State] law with UK moral rights recognition\"*\n\n**Practical Compromise Language:**\n*\"While IP governed by [Your State] law, Vendor retains moral rights under UK law where applicable, and Customer agrees not to assert ownership claims that would violate UK moral rights principles.\"*\n\n**Key Protection Mechanisms:**\n- **Clear Ownership Matrix**: Document what's owned by whom upfront\n- **Work-for-Hire**: Ensure US work-for-hire principles apply to custom development\n- **Enforcement Rights**: Both parties can enforce in either jurisdiction\n- **Licensing Harmony**: Ensure licenses are valid under both legal systems\n\n**Bottom Line:** Push for unified governance under your state law - it's simpler and you're paying for the development.",
